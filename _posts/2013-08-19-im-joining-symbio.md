I’m thrilled to announce that **I’m joining [Symbio](1) as a Front-end Developer, Designer and hopefully in the future &#8211; a Tester!** Symbio is full of great people, and I&#8217;m excited to be a part of the team.

Symbio&#8217;s getting my full attention, and I will not take on any new freelance projects. As I believe you should always strive to grasp the workings of what you’re designing. I’m also picking up some more programming: Drupal and NodeJS. Let’s see where that leads to!

It&#8217;s is still a relatively young company here in Sweden, although they&#8217;re quite big in other regions such as USA, Finland and China. It&#8217;ll be great to be a part of the development of the company since its early stages. Symbio for instance also have some developers and testers over at [Magine](2). This is what ultimately motivates me, designing and developing a product which I utterly love to use as well as the people around me.

I&#8217;d also like to thank my dear friend, and now colleague(!) &#8211; [Viktor Johansson](3) who fundamentally gave me this opportunity!
